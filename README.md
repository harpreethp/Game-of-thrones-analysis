# Game-of-thrones-analysis
Game of Thrones is a hit fantasy tv show based on the equally famous book series "A Song of Fire and Ice" by George RR Martin. The show is well known for its vastly complicated political landscape, large number of characters, and its frequent character deaths.

Visualization done using 2 datasets ,all of which are based on information from the book series.

Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's "The War of the Five Kings" Dataset. Its a great collection of all of the battles in the series.

Secondly we have character-deaths.csv from Erin Pierce and Ben Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival Analysis.
